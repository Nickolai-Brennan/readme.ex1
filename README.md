> [!NOTE]
> To give you a full understanding of the project, we have recorded a short üì∫ [video][gowebly_youtube_video_url] and prepared an introduction üìù [article][gowebly_devto_article_url] demonstrating the main features of the **Gowebly** CLI.

## ‚ö°Ô∏è Quick start

First, [download][go_download_url] and install **Go**. Version `1.21` (or higher) is required.

Now, you can use the **Gowebly** CLI without installation. Just [`go run`][go_run_url] it to create a new project with a [default][repo_default_config] configuration:

```console
go run github.com/gowebly/gowebly@latest create
```

That's it! üî• A wonderful web application has been created in the current folder.

It will use the **net/http** package (as a Go backend) and the **html/template** package (as a template engine). The **htmx** and **hyperscript** packages are already available in your HTML templates.

### üê≥ Docker-way to quick start

Feel free to using the **Gowebly** CLI from our [official Docker image][docker_image_url] and run it in the isolated container:

```console
docker run --rm -it -v ${PWD}:${PWD} -w ${PWD} gowebly/gowebly:latest create
```

> [!IMPORTANT]
> This Docker image works **only** on the GNU/Linux systems (`amd64` or `arm64`, including WSL).

### üç∫ Homebrew-way to quick start

## üìñ Complete user guide

Therefore, to get a complete guide to use and understand the basic principles of the **Gowebly** CLI, we have prepared a comprehensive explanation of the project in this üìñ [Documentation][repo_docs_url].

We hope you find answers to all of your questions! üëå

## üéØ Motivation to create

Tell us, how often have you had to start a new project from scratch and had to make painful manual configurations? ü§î Especially, when you are just getting acquainted with a new technology or stack, where everything is new to you.

For many developers, _including us_, this process is as tedious and even depressing as possible, and doesn't carry any useful workload. It is a **very** frustrating process that can push any developer away from technology a lot.

Why not just give all that awful manual work to machines? Let them do all the hard work for us, and we will just create awesome web products and not have to think about build and deploy.

That's why we created the **Gowebly** CLI and its helpers' library, which helps you start an amazing web applications in **Go** using **htmx**, **hyperscript** and popular atomic/utility-first **CSS frameworks**.

We are here to save you (_and ourselves_) from this routine pain! ‚ú®

> [!NOTE]
> Earlier, we have already saved the world once, it was [Create Go App][cgapp_url] (yep, that's our project too). The [GitHub stars][cgapp_stars_url] statistics of this project can't lie: more than **2.2k** developers of any level and different countries start a new project through this CLI tool.
